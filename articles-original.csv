1,Joe Biden caught 'lying' as he repeats untrue story in latest embarrassing blunder,express,"is facing scrutiny after allegedly misrepresenting his family's educational background during a recent campaign speech in , reigniting a controversy that tarnished a previous bid for the in 1988. during his speech, biden, 81, claimed to be the first in his family to attend college, a statement that contradicts previous assertions and historical records. the president's appearance in wisconsin, a pivotal swing state, aimed to address his administration's policies, particularly his initiatives on student loan forgiveness. however, his remarks veered into his personal history, when he said: ""i, like an awful lot of people in this audience, was the first in my family to go to college and watch my dad struggle to help me get there."" this statement echoes a similar claim made during his ill-fated 1988 presidential campaign, which ended abruptly amid allegations of plagiarism. at the time, biden suspended his campaign following accusations of lifting passages from a speech by former leader neil kinnock without attribution. kinnock's speech, which emphasized his family's struggle to access higher education, served as a template for biden's remarks. biden's speech at the time echoed kinnock's words. at the time, biden said: ""why is it that is the first in his family ever to go to a university? [...] is it because i'm the first biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree that i was smarter than the rest?"" this was remarkably similar to what kinnock said: “why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?"" the politicians also both mentioned thier wives being the first in their family to attend higher education. the controversy surrounding has reignited debate over his credibility and transparency, particularly as he seeks re-election. social media users, including conservative influencers, have seized upon the discrepancy, highlighting previous instances where biden contradicted himself on the same issue. conservative influencer greg price pointed out: "" just said in a speech in wisconsin 'i, like an awful lot of people in this audience, was the first in my family to go to college.' we use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you. this may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. you can unsubscribe at any time. read our ""that is a lie. one of the reasons we know it's a lie is because biden has bragged several times in the past about how his grandfather played college football.” price also shared a post from the rnc research account on showing that the new york times caught biden making the same two contrary claims in 1987. the article reads: ""mr biden had said he was the 'first in his family ever to go to university.' in fact, mr biden said today, 'there are finnegans, my mother’s family, that went to college.'"" get all the latest news, entertainment, sport and lifestyle updates from our dedicated american team. follow on and twitter"

3,Dem-linked political group blasted for meddling in key GOP primary to boost challenger: 'Lame attempt',foxnews,"senate candidate and former navy seal tim sheehy says democrats are spending millions in advertisements against him ""to distract montana voters from jon tester's record."" a california-based group linked to democrats is getting involved in a pennsylvania congressional primary by boosting a republican against a republican incumbent in the latest example of liberal funds being directed toward a gop primary. true patriots pa, a liberal group linked to california democrat rep. eric swalwell, sent out mailers to pennsylvania voters to slam gop rep. brian fitzpatrick and say he is not conservative enough, in essence boosting his primary opponent, mark houck, politico this week. fox news digital obtained some of those mailers that framed fitzpatrick as a ""rino"" (""republican in name only"") and implied he wasn’t conservative enough for the base that supports former president trump. ""maga is ready to bag the biggest rino in congress,"" reads one of the mailers along with a photo of fitzpatrick photoshopped onto a rhinoceros body. ""we sent brian fitzpatrick to d.c. to represent our values, instead, he became best friends with kamala harris and the democrats,"" another mailer said. fec true patriots pa spent roughly $26,000 on the mailer. meagan olson is listed as treasurer for both true patriots pa and the swalwell campaign. ""i consider brian a friend and someone who has bravely defied his party to help secure ukraine aid,"" rep. swalwell told fox news digital in a statement. ""i have never heard of his primary opponent and am not involved or support any effort to defeat brian in the primary. my office uses a professional compliance firm that serves as treasurer for dozens of campaigns."" when reached for comment, the democratic congressional campaign committee (dccc) directed fox news digital to a in january 2024 in which dccc chair rep. suzan delbene said her group no longer supports the strategy of propping up ""far-right"" candidates in swing districts. ""it should come as no surprise that a group connected to eric swalwell, a california democrat who is so dumb that he was tricked into sleeping with a chinese spy, would be propping up self-described chronic masturbator mark houck in the republican primary against brian fitzpatrick,"" defending america pac’s chris pack told fox news digital. ""even democrats as intellectually challenged as eric swalwell know that their best chance at flipping the one seat needed to take back democrat control of the house of representatives is if mark houck beats brian fitzpatrick in the primary next tuesday."" houck, a pro-life activist, has made that he ""had a pornography problem"" as a young man and at a church conference about talking to his son about masturbation and erections. ""i struggled with pornography, and of course that leads to sexual sin, masturbation and stuff. that was a chronic habit,"" houck said in a 2010 interview, which defending america pac titled ""beat it."" in a , houck said he ""fell victim to the dehumanizing effects of the pornography industry"" over ""two decades ago."" he also defended the conversation about his son, saying the clips ""seizes on de-contextualized comments i made with my son present in public pursuit of this transformative ministry"" meant to steer people away from pornography. the democrat group boosting houck is the latest example of a recent trend in which liberal funds have been used to back republican challengers in an effort to sink candidates who support or are supported by former president trump. pacs linked to senate majority leader chuck schumer have meddling in gop primaries this cycle, including in swing state senate races in ohio and montana. duty and country pac, affiliated with schumer, during the ohio gop senate primary that accused trump-backed businessman bernie moreno of being ""too conservative for ohio."" that effort proved unsuccessful in the primary as moreno won every county in the buckeye state, beating his nearest challenger by almost 20 points. in 2022, more than $40 million to boost six pro-trump candidates in republican primaries, and all six of those republicans lost their general election races to democrats. fitzpatrick, who has so far declined to say if he will endorse trump, voted against impeaching trump twice and won re-election in 2022 by almost 10 points, despite biden carrying the 1st congressional district. ""after years of brutal losses, the far-left has finally figured out they have no chance of beating congressman fitzpatrick, so they’ve now tagged california left-wing extremists to meddle in his primary using the same violent political rhetoric they claim to stand against,"" fitzpatrick campaign spokesperson ben trundy told fox news digital in statement. ""this lame attempt to prop up mark houck, an admitted porn addict and serial grifter who believes in complete abortion bans with no exceptions, shows just how desperate they are to force their extreme policies on bucks and montgomery county voters."" andrew mark miller is a reporter at fox news. find him on twitter @andymarkmiller and email tips to andrewmark.miller@fox.com. get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more fox news politics content. subscribed you've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!"
4,Israel's strike on Iran: Crisis shows how badly Iran and Israel understand each other,bbc,"they have been urging israel to draw a line under the dangerous series of events that started with israel's assassination of a senior iranian general in damascus on 1 april. more than six months after the hamas attacks on israel, war continues in gaza and has spread to the area either side of the lebanon-israel border and to the gulf. the fear is that the middle east is on the brink of an all-out war, with global as well as regional dangers. the iranians are playing down the significance of what's happened in isfahan. initial reports said there had been no attack. later, an analyst on state tv said air defences had knocked out drones that had been launched by ""infiltrators"". official media outlets have posted jokey photos of miniature drones. israel was . despite years of enmity and threats it was the first time since the establishment of the islamic republic in 1979 that iran had launched a direct strike from its territory onto israel's. during that attack iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones. almost all of them were destroyed by israel's air defences, augmented by forces from the us, uk and jordan. the iranians had made their intentions clear, giving israel and its allies time to prepare themselves, and quickly issued a statement at the un in new york that their retaliation was over. mr biden urged israel to ""take the win"" but israel insisted it would hit back. from the outset, this crisis has shown how badly iran and israel understand each other. both miscalculated, deepening the crisis. israel seemed to believe that iran would not respond with anything stronger than outrage when it killed general mohammed reza zahedi in damascus. its air strike in damascus, killing six others, including another general. iran announced it regarded the attack as a strike on its own territory. israel claimed the premises were not protected by diplomatic conventions as the iranian islamic revolutionary guard corps had turned them into a military post. iran, and indeed western allies of israel, did not accept a unilateral reclassification of the building's status - and the government in tehran hoped israel would agree to a draw a line after its response. that was another serious miscalculation. if the attack on isfahan is not followed up with more attacks, then the immediate tensions will ease. what happened overnight could be israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu's attempt to respond, without alienating mr biden any more than he has already. if this is it, another question is whether it will be enough for the former generals in israel's war cabinet who are believed to want a strong response to, as they see it, restore israel's capacity to deter its enemies. mr netanyahu's ultranationalist coalition allies have also demanded a fierce retaliation from israel. the national security minister itamar ben gvir said that the israelis needed to ""go berserk"" when iran attacked. in a social media post, he described the isfahan strike as ""feeble"". the best option for the region, in the opinion of western governments, is for both iran and israel to draw a line under the saga. however, even if this is the end of this stage of this crisis, new precedents have been set. iran has hit israel in a direct attack, and israel has responded with its own direct attack. that is a change in what are often referred to in the region as the ""rules of the game"" governing the long conflict between iran and israel. the long clandestine war between the two countries has come out of the shadows. in the process iran and israel have shown that for all the obsessive attention they devote to each other, they are not good at reading each other's intentions. in a highly combustible part of the world, that is not encouraging."
5,Trump threatened with jail if he misses hush money trial as Biden campaigns in Pennsylvania,foxnews,"trump legal spokesperson alina habba joined 'fox & friends first' to discuss the latest on the former president's hush money trial in new york city. president biden returns to the campaign trail on tuesday with a visit to his childhood hometown of scranton to begin three consecutive days of campaigning in pennsylvania. while the democratic incumbent is holding events in the battleground state, his 2024 opponent, is forced to spend the day in a new york city courtroom for the first ever criminal trial of a former president. biden plans to use scranton, a working class city of roughly 75,000 people, as the backdrop to pitch his new tax plan. his travels through pennsylvania overlap with the start of manhattan district attorney alvin bragg’s criminal hush money case against trump. day two of the continues with the jury selection at approximately 9:30 a.m. tuesday. trump has been charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree relating to alleged hush money payments to stormy daniels during his successful 2016 presidential campaign. trump has been ordered to attend the court proceedings tuesday and every day of the trial. judge juan merchan told trump that if he fails to be present, a warrant will be issued for his arrest. biden plans to spend tuesday night in scranton before continuing to pittsburgh on wednesday morning. he is expected to then briefly visit the but intends to return to pennsylvania on thursday, with an event in philadelphia. scranton, biden’s first destination, blends the personal and political for biden as he grew up in a three-story colonial home in the green ridge neighborhood. his family later moved to delaware, the state biden ultimately represented in the u.s. senate. ""it’s hard to draw paths to biden that don’t involve pennsylvania,"" said daniel hopkins, a political science professor at the university of pennsylvania. harry truman, in 1948, was the last democrat to become president who did not win the state. his opportunity to campaign comes as trump is sequestered in a courtroom, defending himself against criminal charges. if convicted, trump could be sentenced to time behind bars. trump pleaded not guilty to all counts last year. as monday showed, however, the criminal case against continues to struggle against worries that trump will get a fair trial. yesterday afternoon, 96 prospective jurors were sworn in but more than 50 of them were almost immediately excused for admitting they could not serve as impartial jurors. ""it’s a scam. it’s a political witch hunt,"" trump said after court adjourned monday. judge juan merchan, who trump has repeatedly criticized as being partisan and serving the addressed trump directly before calling the prospective jurors into the courtroom. the judge told trump that if he fails to be present, a warrant will be issued for his arrest. judge merchan also told trump that he has a right to be present at the trial, but that if he disrupts the proceedings he would be removed. trump nodded after hearing the instructions. judge merchan denied trump’s request to be excused from the trial next thursday, after the president expressed he wanted to attend arguments at the supreme court about presidential immunity. the judge has not yet ruled on whether the trial will be adjourned so trump can attend his son barron’s high school graduation. before jury selection began, judge merchan again denied the defense’s request to recuse himself. judge merchan also set a hearing for next tuesday, april 23 to discuss possible sanctions for trump violating the gag order. get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more fox news politics content. subscribed you've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!"
6,"Pro-life conservatives are 'disappointed' in Trump's new abortion policy, but stick by him: 'Only one option'",foxnews,"fox news’ madison scarpino on trump’s announcement on his abortion policy as the former president brings in over $50 million at a fundraiser conservative groups backing former in his re-election bid say they are ""deeply disappointed"" with his official position on abortion unveiled monday, but it won't deter their support . the former president and presumptive gop nominee in a video posted on truth social monday morning said he cemented his position on the controversial issue, saying that abortion access should be a states’ issue and didn’t endorse a national, federal limitation — like a 15-week ban. who have endorsed trump expressed disappointment at his announcement, but it appears unlikely to sway their support in consideration of trump’s overall stance compared to biden’s extreme abortion policy. ""the reality of a stark choice between president biden who supports abortion: any number, any reason, up until birth, all paid for by the taxpayer and president trump: who gave us three constitutionalist justices, 220 lower court judges, appointees who support life and the overturn of roe v. wade has my endorsement and support in november for president,"" said penny nance, ceo of concerned women for america (cwa), who said she ""favors federal limits on abortion."" trump explicitly affirmed his support for in vitro fertilization (ivf) and emphasized his support for states determining their own laws for abortion so long as there are exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. ""the republican party should always be on the side of the miracle of life and the side of mothers, fathers and their beautiful babies. ivf is an important part of that,"" trump said. ""the states will determine by vote, or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land — in this case, the law of the state,"" trump said. many states will be different. many states will have a different number of weeks… at the end of the day it is all about the will of the people."" trump reiterated that he was proud of the role he played in overturning roe v. wade, saying legal scholars on ""both sides"" had been in favor of the move. which is true— even late justice ruth bader ginsberg said of the ruling that ""doctrinal limbs too swiftly shaped, experience teaches, may prove unstable."" marjorie dannenfelser, president of susan b. anthony pro-life america, said while they are ""deeply disappointed"" in trump’s position, the group will ""work tirelessly to defeat president biden and extreme congressional democrats."" ""unborn children and their mothers deserve national protections and national advocacy from the brutality of the abortion industry,"" she said. ""the dobbs decision clearly allows both states and congress to act."" she added that ""saying the issue is ‘back to the states’ cedes the national debate to the democrats who are working relentlessly to enact legislation mandating abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy. if successful, they will wipe out states’ rights."" since the dobbs decision, factions in both parties in congress have pushed legislation to address abortion. some in the gop camp seeking a 15-week limitation, and some democrats on the other side of the aisle wishing to ""codify"" roe v. wade with virtually limitless abortion access nationwide. jeanne mancini, president of the march for life, said ""there remains an urgent need to advocate for the unborn at the federal level."" she noted that democrats recently tried to enact federal legislation like ""the deceptively titled women's health protection act which would cancel every states’ ability to limit abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, and erases existing pro-life protections for vulnerable women and children nationwide."" trump's position aligns with what more libertarian-leaning groups have endorsed in favor of federalism following the fall of roe. jeffrey miron, vice president of research at the cato institute, wrote in july of 2022 that ""under the libertarian land approach, each state chooses its own policies, which allows for variety and experimentation; more importantly, it avoids the coercion implicit in a federal approach. everyone can try to influence policy in their own state, or move."" ""a key aspect of federalism is that its policy implications align imperfectly with both liberal and conservative views. thus both perspectives will be unhappy, but with more freedom to choose their preferred combination of policies,"" miron wrote. ""that is the best way to accommodate the inevitable differences in views on these and other difficult issues,"" he said. brian burch, president of catholicvote, said that ""while federal legislation on abortion policy is challenging at present, we are confident that a trump administration will be staffed with pro-life personnel committed to pro-life policies, including conscience rights, limits on taxpayer funding of abortion, and protections for pro-life states."" ""president trump’s latest statement also reflects the electoral minefield created by democrat abortion fanaticism. the fact remains that pro-life voters need to win elections to protect mothers and children,"" he said. ""democrats are now preparing a billion-dollar election year barrage with radical abortion as its centerpiece. while trump did not commit to any specific pro-life policies, he notably will not stand in the way of states that have acted to protect innocent children from the violent abortion industry,"" he added. ""[n]o woman should face an unexpected pregnancy alone. we believe a new whole government approach encouraging and supporting pregnant women to keep their children can be advanced under a new trump administration,"" he said. ""the contrast between joe biden and the democrats and president trump is unmistakable. pro-life voters have only one option in november."" brianna herlihy is a politics writer for fox news digital. get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more fox news politics content. subscribed you've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!"
7,Trump’s legal bills drain millions more from his political committees,WashingtonPost,"donald trump is picking up his fundraising pace even as he fights criminal charges in four cases and appeals a nearly half-billion dollar civil fraud judgment against him in new york. but his legal expenses continue to be a tremendous burden on his campaign and its allied groups, the latest campaign finance records show, accounting for 26 percent of the spending in march by his political committees. new federal election commission filings released saturday show that save america leadership pac, a trump-aligned group he has used to pay some of his lawyers, took in $5 million during march and racked up $4.6 million in legal bills for trump and some of his associates. throughout this election cycle, save america has spent the most on legal bills among the groups in trump’s orbit. trump’s political committees have spent at least $16.7 million on legal bills so far this year, and owe another $900,000 to various firms as of the end of march, bringing his overall legal fees since starting his campaign to around $86 million. those costs have continued to siphon money away from the main super pac supporting trump, maga inc., which agreed to refund $60 million to save america last year. they transferred $52.25 million in “contribution refunds” back to the leadership pac in 12 installments that began last may. maga inc. made another transfer of $5 million back to the leadership pac in march, accounting for almost all of save america’s money flowing in, new reports show. fec reports do not require candidates or their leadership pacs to disclose what legal matters each lawyer or law firm handled when they report payments to those firms. still, there are signs that trump’s efforts to portray his legal troubles as unjust attacks are convincing grass-roots donors to keep giving to his campaign. the fec data show that at one key moment in the civil fraud case, for example — march 22, when he was being asked to post a bond of several hundred-million dollars to keep new york authorities from seizing his assets — donations to his campaign spiked. a new york appeals court panel later said that former president donald trump would be allowed to post a reduced bond of $175 million. on march 22, trump wrote an all-caps post on his truth social platform claiming that he had almost $500 million in cash, “a substantial amount of which i intended to use in my campaign for president.” he claimed in the post that the judge in the case was trying to take that money away from him. (trump’s attorneys had said in a march 18 court filing that he was unable to finance an appeal bond of more than $450 million to cover the judgment in the business fraud case.) it was his best fundraising day since his mug shot was taken in fulton county, ga., in august. in the last half of march, after clinching the republican nomination, trump has averaged over $1.2 million a day via the online fundraising platform winred. campaign finance records filed this week show that the joint trump fundraising effort with the republican national committee is raking in big checks, with key donors giving the maximum of more than $800,000. but the gop nominee’s available cash at the end of march still trailed far behind what biden and allied democratic groups had stashed. maga inc., the trump-aligned super pac, netted large checks from some of the republican party’s biggest donors. robert bigelow gave another $4.1 million to the super pac — bringing the total he has donated to maga inc. to $9.2 million. linda mcmahon, who headed the small business administration during the trump administration and now chairs the america first policy institute, gave $5 million to the group. maga inc. said it had about $33 million in cash on hand at the end of march after it refunded $5 million to save america. here are some other key takeaways from the latest filings: a vice-presidential windfall for kennedy nicole shanahan’s personal wealth was one of her chief assets when robert f. kennedy jr. chose her as his running mate for his long-shot independent bid for the white house. fec records show that shanahan helped to replenish kennedy’s campaign treasury a day after joining the ticket on march 26 — donating $2 million to the campaign. the money is a much-needed infusion that could bolster kennedy’s efforts to get on the ballot in as many states as possible. as a candidate, shanahan can donate an unlimited amount of money to the campaign. before joining the ticket, shanahan had donated the maximum of $6,600 to kennedy’s campaign. her venture firm, planeta management llc gave $500,000 in july to common sense pac, another outside group supporting kennedy. planeta management llc also gave $4 million in january to american values 2024, a super pac supporting kennedy — money that helped pay for a pro-kennedy ad during the super bowl. democrats tout financial advantage as they seek house control reports filed to the fec this week showed the democrats extending their fundraising advantage well beyond the presidential race to many key areas in the battle for control of the house and senate. the republican national committee, which was struggling to raise cash throughout the gop primary, doubled its cash on hand, ending march with $22 million in cash. but the democratic national committee still has double that amount in its war chest — reporting $45.2 million in cash at the end of march. the national republican congressional committee, which is focused on house races, had nearly $56 million in cash on hand at the end of march, significantly less than the democratic congressional campaign committee, which had $71.1 million in cash. the other influential groups involved in the competitive house races are also raising money at a fast clip on both sides of the aisle. the gop-aligned congressional leadership fund super pac reported that it had nearly $68.6 million in cash to spend on key races at the end of march, while the house majority pac reported $63.2 million in cash remaining at the end of the period in filings on saturday. though senate republicans are facing a much more favorable map and managed to recruit several wealthy contenders in key races, some of the most vulnerable democratic incumbents are amassing huge war chests. that group includes sen. jon tester (mont.), who had nearly $12.7 million in cash at the end of march; and sen. sherrod brown (ohio), who had nearly $16 million in cash at the end of the period. both are defending seats in states that trump won in 2016 and 2020. sen. jacky rosen of nevada, a state that democrats narrowly carried in the 2016 and 2020 presidential races, reported more than $13.2 million in cash at the end of march, preparing her for a difficult race in november. sam brown, a retired army captain who is the front-runner in the gop race, had about $2.3 million in cash at the end of march. his republican rival, former ambassador jeff gunter, reported nearly $2.6 million in his campaign treasury after loaning his campaign $2.7 million."
8,"Biden flexes his cash advantage, GOP megadonors spend big in latest FEC filings",WashingtonPost,"president biden and the democratic groups allied with his campaign continue to demonstrate an enormous cash advantage over donald trump’s presidential effort with nearly six months until the election. down the ballot, new federal election commission filings from the first quarter of 2024 show a leading democratic super pac outpacing its gop counterpart in the battle for the senate. and in several key senate races, democratic hopefuls outraised their republican rivals. democrats’ hopes of maintaining control of the u.s. senate — where they have a slim 51-49 majority — have long looked difficult because the 2024 map is far more favorable to republicans. democrats are trying to defend 23 seats in the senate — including three held by independents who caucus with democrats — while republicans need to hold just 11. the democratic party’s task is complicated by the fact that they are all but certain to lose the seat of retiring sen. joe manchin iii, a conservative democrat in deep-red west virginia. democratic groups are pouring resources into ohio and montana to help incumbent sens. sherrod brown and jon tester defend their seats in states trump carried in 2016 and 2020. democrats are also defending their senate seats in pennsylvania, wisconsin and nevada — states that are key to the presidential race — as well as michigan, where democratic sen. debbie stabenow is retiring. both michigan and arizona are open seats. the senate leadership fund, which supports republicans, posted strong numbers in the first quarter of the year — raising $26 million, nearly doubling their cash on hand ($59.5 million). but senate majority pac, an independent group associated with majority leader charles e. schumer, outperformed its republican counterparts — raising nearly $38.9 million during the quarter and ending the three-month period with $92 million in cash on hand. senate majority pac has reserved $239 million in ads to defend seats in seven states. congressional republicans have expressed concerns about their ability to hold on to the party’s slim house majority in november. those fears have been amplified in recent weeks by georgia rep. marjorie taylor greene’s threat to try to oust speaker mike johnson (r-la.) over a ukraine funding dispute, as well as the looming departure of rep. mike gallagher (r-wis.), who will vacate his seat at the end of the week. gallagher’s exit will leave republicans with a one-vote majority — their smallest in decades. the congressional leadership fund, a super pac that is supporting republican house candidates across the country, reported raising $18.8 million in march — and a total of $25 million in the first three months of this year. at the end of march, the group reported nearly $68.6 million in cash on hand. house majority pac, which backs democrats, will not file its report until april 20. but the group has said it raised $37 million with its affiliated organization house majority forward in the first quarter — demonstrating its advantage over clf. biden maintains his cash edge over trump though reports filed monday continued to show biden’s huge cash advantage over trump, they also offered a partial picture of the big money flowing into a new trump super pac, right for america, which raised $13 million in the first quarter and spent nothing. the major donors to the committee were ike and laura perlmutter, who donated $10.1 million, and anthony lomangino, the palm beach-based chairman and founder of southern waste systems, who gave $1.1. million. the leadership pac that trump has primarily used to pay his legal fees, save america, will not file its next report until april 20. but trump, the presumptive republican nominee, spent $1.7 million on legal fees in the first quarter through another committee, make america great again pac. that group also spent $400,000 on “document hosting” fees that are often related to discovery in legal cases. trump spent more than $55 million on legal fees in 2023, creating a strain on overall fundraising effort as he fights criminal charges in four cases. in addition, patriot legal defense fund, a separate political organization that has paid legal bills for some trump associates, reported raising about $390,000 and spending $478,000 in the first three months of 2024. the group’s fundraising was largely driven by chicago cubs owner marlene ricketts, who gave $250,000 to the fund, and jerry daniels of venice, fla., who gave $100,000. almost all of pldf’s first-quarter spending went to digital forensics firm haystackid, which offers services related to legal e-discovery. the biden campaign announced earlier this month that it raised more than $90 million in march and that the broader biden effort had about $192 million in cash at the end of the month — more than double what their rivals are holding in their war chest. reports from some biden committees, alongside democratic super pacs, showed the generosity of top democratic donors such as megadonor james simons, who gave $2.5 million each to the future forward super pac and the senate majority pac in the first three months of the year. he was joined by businessman fred eychaner, kenneth and jennifer duda of menlo park, calif., and others in writing seven-figure checks to future forward, which raised $20 million in the first quarter of the year and has promised to spend $250 million on ads supporting biden. one notable donor to biden’s effort was david ellison, the ceo of skydance media, who gave the maximum of $929,600 to the biden victory fund in the first quarter. david ellison is the son of oracle ceo larry ellison, who has backed trump in previous cycles and donated millions of dollars in the 2024 cycle to committees that were supporting south carolina gop sen. tim scott when he ran unsuccessfully for the gop nomination. by comparison, the trump campaign and the rnc said they raised $65.6 million in march and ended the month with about $93 million in cash. trump is raising money jointly with the republican national committee after his contested primary race for the gop nomination, and he has immersed himself in the effort to close the gap with democrats in recent months. trump’s new joint fundraising committee with the rnc, the trump 47 committee, brought in $23.6 million, nearly all of it in march. before a palm beach fundraiser this month that the republican national committee said raised more than $50.5 million, trump held frequent calls with donors and kept close tabs on which donors had written a check for the maximum of more than $800,000. the money from those checks is divided among trump’s campaign, save america, the rnc and more than three dozen state party committees. trump’s fundraising efforts appear to be paying off. the trump 47 committee collected checks totaling more than $800,000 from robert mercer, the billionaire hedge fund magnate; linda mcmahon, the former professional wrestling executive who served as trump’s head of the small business association; casino mogul phil ruffin; woody johnson, the owner of the new york jets, and his wife suzanne; and joe ricketts, the founder of td ameritrade. senate democratic contenders raise big, while gop self-funded candidates spend big democrats in some of the most closely watched senate races have sprinted out to an advantage over their republican competitors. in arizona for example, rep. ruben gallego (d) has $9.6 million in his campaign account versus $2.5 million for republican kari lake. in the race for michigan’s open senate seat, rep. elissa slotkin (d-mich.) outraised gop front-runner mike rogers, a former congressman, by more than 4 to 1. slotkin, a former cia analyst, reported $8.6 million in cash on hand at the end of the march, compared to rogers’s nearly $1.4 million. sam brown, a retired u.s. army captain and purple heart recipient who is challenging nevada sen. jacky rosen and has the backing of the national republican senatorial committee, raised about half as much as the $5 million rosen raised during the first quarter. rosen had $13 million in cash on hand at the end of the period, compared to brown’s $2.3 million. brown’s gop rival, jeff gunter, an independently wealthy physician who has played up his ties to trump as his former ambassador to iceland, loaned his campaign $2.7 million. gunter recently told fox news that he intends to spend at least $3.3 million on ads in nevada to boost his candidacy before nevada’s june primary. the ad introduces gunter as “trump’s ambassador” and states that he is “110% pro-trump.” hovde, a banking executive who is challenging sen. tammy baldwin, reported monday that he raised $9 million in the first quarter of this year — including $8 million that he loaned to himself. at the end of march, he reported $5.35 million in cash, compared to baldwin’s more than $10 million. baldwin raised $5.4 million over the first three months of the year and spent $3.1 million. tim sheehy, the former navy seal challenging tester in montana, loaned another $500,000 to his senate campaign — bringing the total he has loaned to his campaign to $1.45 million so far this cycle. the republican candidate, who owns an aerial firefighting business, has been at the center of controversy in the montana race after the washington post detailed inconsistent accounts he has given over the years about his alleged war wounds. sheehy reported $1.9 million in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter after raising $3 million and spending about $2.4 million. the montanans for tester group reported raising $8 million during the quarter, spending $6.4 million and ending the three-month period with about $12.6 million in cash on hand. megadonors make a play in key senate races ken griffin, one of the biggest donors to the republican party who ultimately put money behind the super pac supporting nikki haley in her battle against trump, is turning his attention to senate and house races. griffin donated $10 million to a newly formed super pac, maryland’s future, at a moment when former governor larry hogan, a republican, is making a play for the senate seat in a blue state. hogan upended the race when he made a surprise entrance earlier this year, and a washington post-university of maryland poll released in march showed him leading his democratic rivals by double digits. several maryland democrats — including rep. david trone and prince george’s county executive angela alsobrooks — are facing off in the may 14 primary for the seat that is being vacated by retiring sen. ben cardin (d-md.). trone loaned his campaign another $18.5 million in the first quarter and reported less than $1 million in cash. monday’s reports show that trone has now loaned more than $41.7 million to his campaign. griffin also gave $4 million to the congressional leadership fund in march and $5 million to american patriots pac, which aims to elect conservative veterans to congress. republican megadonor paul singer also gave $1 million to american patriots group, which has spent very little so far. american patriots pac placed ads earlier this year in support of republican laurie buckhout, a retired army colonel who is running against democratic rep. don davis in north carolina’s 1st district. the cook political report has cast that race as a toss-up. though some democratic incumbents posted an impressive total in hotly contested senate races, republicans have fielded several wealthy candidates who can fund their own campaigns, including tim sheehy in montana and eric hovde in wisconsin, both of whom are backed by trump."
