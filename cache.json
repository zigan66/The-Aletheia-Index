        "article_text": "Any time you buy two of something and get a third item for half off, or add a few dollars to an online order to secure free shipping, you are \u201cspaving.\u201d  is a mashup of \u201cspending\u201d and \u201csaving\u201d: spending more to trigger savings. But don\u2019t fool yourself, experts say: Spaving is mostly spending. \u201cIt\u2019s always more spending. It\u2019s not always more saving,\u201d said , an associate professor of marketing at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Spaving has been  lately. It sounds like something new: The term has seldom appeared in this publication. It isn\u2019t in the online Merriam-Webster . Type it into your word processor and watch your spellchecker erupt in protest.   The concept behind spaving, however, goes wa-a-ay back. \u201cSpaving, besides being a terrible word, is not a new idea,\u201d Galak said. \u201cThese promotions have been around forever.\u201d Here\u2019s the basic concept: A merchant entices a customer to spend a little more, or a lot more, by offering a discount as a reward. Buy a third item, or a fourth, or a fifth, and get the last one free. Add another ten dollars to your cart, and that $5 shipping fee goes away. Who needs a gallon of extra-virgin olive oil? Maybe you do, at the right price. Customers may be seeing a lot of spaving offers this summer. Inflation has been pushing up prices. A dozen eggs cost  what they did in 2019. Overall, consumer prices rose by  between 2019 and 2023, federal data show. Consumers are pushing back. In response, retailers are rolling out deals. Fast food chains are  in the wake of consumer backlash against reports of  .  and  have announced summer price cuts. More customers are choosing discounted . Spending less for the same Happy Meal you bought a week ago is a no-brainer. Spaving, by contrast, can quickly spiral out of control. The problem with spaving, experts say, is that it can lead a shopper to overspend on something they did not want, do not need and will not use. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to save money. The problem is when you\u2019re spending money you wouldn\u2019t have spent otherwise,\u201d said , a personal finance expert at NerdWallet. Palmer herself recently succumbed to a spaving offer. \u201cIt was a buy one, get one free,\u201d she said. \u201cI never intended to get a second shirt. It was for my daughter. I went ahead and bought two.\u201d The second shirt was free, so Palmer got a great deal, right? Well, maybe not. She paid full price for the first shirt. Absent the spaving deal, she would have held out for a discount. In the end, she said, \u201cI did spend more than I wanted to.\u201d There is really only one kind of spaving offer that guarantees a good deal, experts say: One that has you spending less money in the end. \u201cSay you\u2019re going to check out, and your cart is $5 short of the minimum to save you $30 on shipping,\u201d said , an analyst at WalletHub. \u201cThen, maybe spending the $5 to get the free shipping is a good idea.\u201d Most of the time, though, spaving makes you spend more: That\u2019s the point, at least from the retailer\u2019s perspective. And if you are spending more, are you still getting a better deal? It depends. Before you commit to buying more of something to trigger a discount, experts say, ask yourself these questions: Stocking up on laundry pods, or frozen steaks, or paper napkins at volume-discount prices might make all the sense in the world. \u201cMy husband and I both work from home,\u201d Happe said. \u201cSo, necessities like toilet paper, stuff like that, we buy that in bulk now, because we know we\u2019re going to go through it.\u201d Be careful, though, if you see a spaving offer on ears of corn, or bananas, or nonfrozen steaks. Or anything with a short shelf life. Or anything your family might tire of consuming. Or anything you wouldn\u2019t buy anyway. The appeal of spaving is obvious: Consumers like to think they are saving money. \u201cYou get that temporary emotional high because you feel like you locked in a good deal,\u201d said , a partner at Crewe Advisors in Scottsdale, Arizona. The problem comes, Yamano said, when consumers want to save money so badly that they end up spending more of it, and on things they won't use. \u201cYou walk into Target, and you\u2019re just there to buy dish soap,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then there\u2019s a deal in the next aisle, and you\u2019re walking out with a cart full of stuff you don\u2019t need.\u201d The arithmetic behind spaving can be tricky. Let\u2019s say you buy three pairs of shoes, with the third offered at 50% off. A quick calculation reveals that you\u2019re not really saving 50%. You\u2019re only saving that much on one item. If each pair costs $50, you save $25 on the entire purchase, lowering the tab from $150 to $125: a savings of about 17%. And what if the third pair costs only $30? In the typical spaving deal, the retailer takes the discount on the cheapest item. Now, you\u2019re saving only $15, lowering the price from $130 to $115. Your savings drops below 12%. A consumer can figure this out with an iPhone calculator. But few of us have time to do the math. \u201cA lot of times, with spaving, it\u2019s a high-pressure situation,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to expire in the next few hours, at the end of the day, so there\u2019s some urgency to it.\u201d Here are a few more expert tips on how to shop \u2013 and \u201cspave\u201d \u2013 without overspending: \"I will give myself 24 to 48 hours before purchasing something,\" said  , head of money wellness at Ally Financial. After that pause, she said, \"if it's still on my brain, then it's OK.\"",

The Messages app will have a lot of new features coming thanks to iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence, Apple leaders announced Monday.

The app will also tell users if their passwords are weak or have been used multiple times.
