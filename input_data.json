      "article_text": "Voters in a slew of states could see   explicitly on the ballot this year, in the form of proposed constitutional amendments. \u00a0 To be effective, though, Democrats say they\u2019ll also need to secure statehouse victories in 2024.\u00a0 The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, an organization focused on electing Democrats at the state level, said in a memo Thursday that these referendums \u201ccan be an immediate or initial fix, but the long term building of power in state legislatures is the most effective way\u201d to secure abortion access for Americans across the country. Abortion rights advocates have been on a ballot measure winning streak since 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a 1973 case guaranteeing the constitutional right to an abortion.\u00a0 But as some of those successful measures have faced Republican-led challenges after Election Day, and with several states not allowing for citizen-led ballot initiatives, DLCC President Heather Williams told USA TODAY the organization's focus goes beyond ballot measures.\u00a0 \u201cThese initiatives are incredibly important. Enshrining the right to an abortion in a state's constitution is really incredibly important,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cThese measures are an important piece,\u201d Williams added. \u201cBut we know that without also building power in the state houses, we're not doing enough. We've got to do it all.\u201d\u00a0 The DLCC announced a $60 million budget in January to boost candidates and reach out to voters about abortion rights. They have not yet announced any new investments into this focus. But the group and other advocates are sounding the alarm on reproductive rights in 2024 and warning that ballot measures are not an end-all solution.\u00a0 At least four states will include on November\u2019s ballot a measure to enshrine abortion access in their constitution, and related initiatives continue in about a dozen other states.\u00a0 But, Williams said, the fight is also in state legislatures.\u00a0 The DLCC hopes to grow Democrats\u2019 presence and potentially gain new majorities\u00a0to \u201cmaximize the impact of ballot measures\u201d in states where they appear on this year\u2019s ballot, according to Thursday's memo.\u00a0 In some of those states, including Florida and Missouri, Republicans hold a statehouse supermajority, making the implementation of any ballot measure that passes potentially complicated.\u00a0 For example, after Ohio voters last November passed an abortion referendum to enshrine abortion access, Republicans in the Buckeye State  to \u201cdo everything in (their) power\u201d to block the move.\u00a0 And advocates are already anticipating a similar response in Florida, where the GOP legislature has a   voter-approved reforms.\u00a0 As of Wednesday, abortions in Florida are  , with exceptions for rape, incest and human trafficking. November\u2019s ballot measure in the Sunshine State has the potential to reverse this law and extend the limit to viability, around 24 weeks, but Democrats warn the process will likely be drawn out.\u00a0 \u201cCome November, if, when this amendment passes, that is not going to turn the spigot on or change things overnight,\u201d Florida state Senate Minority Leader Lauren Book told reporters Tuesday.\u00a0 \u201cIt'll probably have to go before the courts and the courts will hopefully rule in that favor, but it's not going to change overnight,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is a reality that women and girls will have to live under, for quite some time before a change is made.\u201d\u00a0 Another reason to pay attention to control of statehouses, Williams said:   do not offer residents the option of a having a citizen-led ballot initiative.\u00a0 On that list is North Carolina, where abortions are banned after 12 weeks, with exceptions.\u00a0 \u201cI get asked that question every time there's a successful initiative in another state, if we can do that, and it's just not something that we're able to,\u201d said Tara Romano, executive director of Pro-Choice North Carolina.\u00a0 But Williams said states like Romano\u2019s will not \u201cget left out\u201d of attempts to increase abortion access.\u00a0 \u201cIt is being done by Democrats in power in the statehouses,\u201d she said, pointing to places like Michigan where a Democratic trifecta   with its Reproductive Health Act earlier this year.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the DLCC will be watching voter behavior in 2024 as guidance for future elections on expanding Democratic majorities across the map, Williams said.\u00a0 \u201cUnderstanding how people show up, how it energizes folks, how abortion plays in these communities will be an important learning lesson.\u201d",
